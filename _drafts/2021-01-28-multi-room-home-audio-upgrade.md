## Mutli-room home audio upgrade

I recently moved into a house with a cool, but obsolete (and broken) SystemLine multi-room home audio system.  It has 5 'zones', master bedroom, bathroom, living room, kitchen, garden with equipment as follows:

### Current system

#### Zones:
- Master bedroom: 2 passive wall mounted speakers, wall mounted touchscreen control unit, wall socket RCA sound input/output unit.
- Bathroom: ceiling  mounted 'active' speaker unit.
- Living room: 4 passive speaker plug sockets ('banana plugs') wired in series for left and right, same touchscreen and wall socket RCA as bedroom.
- Kitchen: same as master bedroom, but also with an old-school iPod dock.
- Garden: speaker cables - i've only found one so far, with a small control pad just inside the door.

In all cases, everything is wired to a central location via standard audio cable (for passive speakers), or  cat5 ethernet cable (with a redunant extra cat5 cable!) for everything else.

#### Audio and control hardware:
- 2 Harman Kardon TU-970 DAB digital radio receviers with IR controllers attached.
- 1 Harman Kardon DVD player (I think used for playing CDS) with IR controller attached.
- 1 Old school iPod dock.
- 4 SystemLine 'zone amplifers', one for each passive zone.
- 2 SystemLine control unit things.

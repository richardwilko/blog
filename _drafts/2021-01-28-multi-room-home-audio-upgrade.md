## Mutli-room home audio upgrade


I recently moved into a house with a cool, but obsolete (and not working) SystemLine multi-room home audio system.  It has 5 'zones', master bedroom, bathroom, living room, kitchen, garden with equipment as follows:

- Master bedroom: 2 passive, wall mounted speakers wired to a central unit, wall mounted touchscreen control unit, wall socket RCA sound input/output unit, going to the central unit.
- Bathroom: ceiling  mouted 'active' speaker unit.
- Living room: 4 passive speaker plug sockets ('banana plugs'), wired in series for left and right, going to the central unit, touchscreen and wall socket RCA.
- Kitchen: same as master bedroom, but also with an old-school iPod dock.
- Garden: speaker cable wired to central unit, with a small control pad just inside the door.
